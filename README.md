# Etch-A-Sketch-OdinProject

I created this while going through the Odin Project.

I learned many thuings while doing this project:

1. this was the first project I used html, css, and JavaScript
2. I used both CSS Grid and flexbox for the UI
3. while doing this project, I taught myself CSS Grid and had previous exposure to flexbox earlier in the program
4. I became much more competent in html, css, and JavaScript
5. I was able to work through difficult problems and find the resources needed to help me finish this project
